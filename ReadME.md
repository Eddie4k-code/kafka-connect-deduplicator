# 🔁 DuplicateMessageDetector

A Kafka Connect **Single Message Transform (SMT)** that detects and filters out duplicate messages based on a **unique key** field in the record. This is useful in streaming pipelines where upstream systems may occasionally produce repeated records.

Supports both **schemaless** and **schema-based** records, and allows flexible configuration of how to find and identify the unique key.
